            <Typography variant="body2" color="textSecondary" component="p">
            I recently received my Full Stack Web Development certificate from the University of Oregon bootcamp. I have a particular interest in database management, security, and UX but enjoy most all elements of development and engineering.
              <br />  <br />  
              I graduated from Reed College with a degree in Political Science primarily focusing on large scale voter behavior and building predictive models. While at Reed I worked as a research assistant for the Early Voting Information Center helping to build out the front facing web application and as an Editorial Assistant for the Election Law Journal.

              <br />  <br /> 
              As an eager learner and natural helper, Iâ€™m excited to use my technical skills and collaborative nature to write cleaner code, identify errors, and help your team to continue to develop innovative and enticing work.
